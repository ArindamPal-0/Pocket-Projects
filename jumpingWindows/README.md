# jumpingWindows
Make your windows bounce and jump. 
# Requirements
Requires python3 and pywin32 module. Only works on the Windows operating system.
# Usage
Basic usage is to just provide part of the window name you want to be bouncing, e.g.
```batch
python bounce.py Untitled
```
for the newly created notepad window. More options are listed in help:
```batch
python bounce.py -h
```
You can stop the bouncing by triggering a keyboard interrupt in the running console.
